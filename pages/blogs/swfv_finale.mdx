## VPOP Mission

### SOFIRE

This was so cute. Ok SOFIRE I see you.

They look so cute. Also the baby freeze was so cute lol.

Dance wasn't very complex tho. Was engaging regardless.

The prop usage was good.

### HNXG

Chloe MOTHER HELLO???

Lol everyone using props. Honestly, the baseball bat was used not very effectively. The first half suffered because of it I feel. But they really pulled in with the second half.

The sheer power that HNXG brings is so delightful to me. I'll miss it ðŸ˜­.

Why tf are they showing Chec's husband. Bffr Madison media group.

These outfits fucking eat hello.

Chloe side-eye IJBOL. Not her crying. She's the JJ of SWF-V for me.

Bro, it must be so hard for EnV as leader. I respect her so much.

### FED

BRUHHHH OMGGGG

They did not play it safe at all today. They did locking and top-rock too. I'm so impressed by FED's performance today. This one I'll rewatch again too. It was so brilliantly done. Also, the concept was so well done. WOW.

Girl actually unironcially gave 100 lol? In my head I was like if I gave 97 to hnxg, i'll give 100 to them... AND SHE ACTUALLY DID?? LOL.

No this was such a good performance. I want to rewatch it rn itself sldkfmdslkfmdsf.

Gurl why did they not do it live? and do an audience vote. It would've been so much fun if it was live.

Balienzz in the BUILDING!!! *I missed her* ðŸ˜­.

## Same song mission

### HNXG

Ok the prop usage was so good here. Let's go. They made a really complex choreo too. I really liked it.

Not Chloe crying again I love her.

### SOFIRE

This is the first time I've seen Linh Lei mad. LOL it was a prank.

MANSOHIGH getting the screentime made me really happy.

Girl is giving 100s like it's a fucking ladoo LIKE please.

### FED

Im sorry but they deserve to win. The formations in the first half were insane. It kind of lost the momentum in the second half but still a really great performance from them.

They really did things that were way out of what I'll expect from FED so I really like this.

Also, I'm in LOVE with Linh PC like *I GET HER*.

NAUR. 3rd place for HNXG doesn't make sense to me please. They should've been 2nd place.

FED deserves this tho YES.
